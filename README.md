# BuildInfo
Sample Swift project for collecting multiple pieces of info  
Based on some discussion in #bash in the MacAdmins Slack (http://macadmins.org), I wanted to put together a basic application for collecting data from a user without resorting to multiple AppleScript display dialogs or the like.  
See the [post about this](https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/using-a-swift-app-to-get-rid-of-lots-of-applescript-dialogs/) for more info.
